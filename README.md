\# ☕ Coffee Shop Application (Java)

## 📌 Project Overview
The Coffee Shop Application is a simple Java console-based program that demonstrates the concept of **Method Overloading**.

The program allows customers to order coffee in different ways:
- By size
- By size and type
- By size, type, and extra shot option

This project clearly explains how Java handles multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.

## 🚀 Features
- Order coffee by size only
- Order coffee by size and type
- Order coffee with optional extra shot
- Demonstrates method overloading
- Simple and easy-to-understand console output

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Method Overloading

---

## 💻 How the Program Works
1. The `Main` class creates an object of the `CoffeeShop` class.
2. The `coffee()` method is called with different parameters.
3. Java selects the correct method based on the number and type of arguments passed.
4. The program prints the customer’s coffee order.

Example method calls:
- coffee("Medium")
- coffee("Medium", "Espresso")
- coffee("Medium", "Espresso", true)
